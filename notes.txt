test for a better, more robust, more general graph case
referencing and dependency included as priority from the start

referencing trees has been very difficult to understand when the
tree itself is a dag graph - how do we track deltas in graph structure from
what the reference should be?

each tree node knows the structure of all its branches as a set of nodes, and
a set of edges connecting those nodes

also helps to solve the more general problem of referencing specific subgraphs

child nodes held as "refSubgraph" in ref node data?

ignore transforms for now - only direct referencing
graph.createReferenceNode(fromNode) - returns new node, not added to graph
